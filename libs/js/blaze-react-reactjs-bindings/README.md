reactjs-bindings by Simon Meier <iridcode@gmail.com> based on Luite Stegemans
virtual-dom bindings.


to initiate:

    $ npm install

to build

    $ grunt


to watch for changes and rebuild

    $ grunt watch

Note that the output will be a single library containing both our custom
bindings and a copy of Facebook's ReactJS.
