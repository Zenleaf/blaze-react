-- | The DOM has two ways of describing keyboard events: by Keycode, or by
-- Charcode. The Keycode represents the physical key which was involved,
-- whereas the Charcode represents the resulting character. Therefore, a
-- typical keyboard interaction might yeild the following events:
--
-- > KeyDown Keycode.shift
-- > KeyDown Keycode.letterA
-- > KeyPress (Charcode.fromChar 'A')
-- > KeyUp Keycode.letterA
-- > KeyUp Keycode.shift
module Text.Blaze.Event.Charcode
    ( Charcode
    , unCharcode
    , fromChar
    ) where

-- | A representation of an ASCII character.
newtype Charcode = Charcode { unCharcode :: Int }


-- TODO (AS): Make explicit constructors, or perhaps a quasi-quotation.
fromChar :: Char -> Charcode
fromChar c = case fromEnum c of
    x | x < 128 -> Charcode x -- It's ASCII
    _           -> error "mkCharcode: Not ASCII"
